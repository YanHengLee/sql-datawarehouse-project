## 🚀 Project Requirements

### 1. Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

### Specifications
* **Data Sources**: Import data from two sources systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
* **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
* **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
* **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
* **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

### 2. BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analytics)

### Objective
Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:
* **Customer Behaviour**
